Estimation Methods


Top down Approach

Top-down estimating is a process that involves looking at a project from a broad view and coming up with a total estimate for it. 
This method is typically done by management who want to come up with a budget or overall time estimate for a project


Bottom Up 
This approach looks at the individual components/elements of the project and adds them together to get the total estimate.
With the bottom-up estimation methods, companies rely on those who will actually be doing the project to come up with an accurate estimate, in most cases.
